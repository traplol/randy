pass: str cap is 0
pass: str len is 1
pass: str cap is 1
pass: str len is 4
pass: other len is 0
pass: other cap is 4
pass: other len is 4
pass: other cap is 4
pass: empty is equal to empty

Testing cstrings.
pass: cstr_eq("", "") is equal
pass: cstr_eq(NULL, NULL) is equal
pass: cstr_eq("", NULL) is not equal
pass: cstr_eq(NULL, "") is not equal
pass: same cstrings are equal
pass: same cstring with different case are not equal
pass: different cstring are not equal
pass: cstring "foo" length is 3
pass: cstring "" length is 0
Testing strings can be large.
